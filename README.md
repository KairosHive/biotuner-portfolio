# **Biotuner Portfolio**

A digital portfolio documenting the aesthetic outcomes of the **Biotuner** project—a Python toolbox for the sonification of biological and non-biological signals. This platform explores the intersection of neurophenomenology, generative music, and signal processing.

## **Overview**

Biotuner treats the harmonic architecture of measured biological rhythms as a compositional medium. By mapping time-series data (EEG, ECG, plant bio-signals, etc.) to musical intervals, we uncover hidden consonance and dissonance within natural dynamics.

This website serves as:
- A specific **Manifesto** of the theoretical concepts (Harmonicity, Tuning Systems).
- A **Gallery** of sonifications and artistic collaborations.
- A gateway to the [**Biotuner Engine**](https://biotuner.kairos-creation.org).
